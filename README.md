# Advance Analytics and Visualization in R
## Objectives:
1. Discuss some of the R packages that improve the efficiency for data analytic
2. Cover the intiutive data analytic tools for analyzing different data sets
3. Apply different visualization tools to represent the data

### Section 1: Applying dplyr Package to Increase Efficiency
dplyr package is based on plyr package, developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). The package starts with "d" to emphasize the use on "data.frame".  For "list" and "vector", it will be handled by a separated package "purrr", which will be covered in section 2. It worth to note that the dplyr package has significantly improved the efficiency and computational speed for R users.  It also offers a better readability coding logic for average R users, especially people who are already fimilar with database query language.
