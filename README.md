# Advance Analytics and Visualization in R
## Objectives:
1. Discuss some of the R packages that improve the efficiency for data analytic
2. Cover the intiutive data analytic tools for analyzing different data sets
3. Apply different visualization tools to represent the data

## Index:
### Section 1: Applying dplyr Package to Increase Efficiency
dplyr package is based on plyr package, developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). The package starts with "d" to emphasize the use on "data.frame".  For "list" and "vector", it will be handled by a separated package "purrr", which will be covered in section 2. It worth to note that the dplyr package has significantly improved the efficiency and computational speed for R users.  It also offers a better readability coding logic for average R users, especially people who are already fimilar with database query language.
- 1.1: tbl Object & data.frame
- 1.2: Select
- 1.3: Partial Match
- 1.4: Filter
- 1.5: Slice
- 1.6: Mutate
- 1.7: Summarize
- 1.8: Group By
- 1.9: Arrange
- 1.10: Do
- 1.11: dplyr with Database

### Section 2: Applying purrr for List and Vector
R has many packages to process a list or vector of elements.  Among all these packages, purrr, developed by Hadley Wickham, is one of the most standardized and efficient package to handle list or vector computation.  The name "purrr" emphasizes the idea of "pure" functional programming design rooted from R.  
- 2.1: Map
- 2.2: Return Data Type from Map
- 2.3: Map a Data Frame
- 2.4: Map over Multiple Inputs

### Section 3: Applying Tidyverse for Data Organization


### Section 4: Applying lattice and ggplot2 for Visualization
